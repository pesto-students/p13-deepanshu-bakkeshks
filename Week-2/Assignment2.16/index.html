      <p class="lyrics">
        Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has
        gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.
      </p>
      <p class="lyrics">
        Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a
        milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly.
      </p>
      <p class="lyrics">
        I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say. Now all my data's
        gone And I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.
      </p>
      <p class="lyrics">
        Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was
        all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.
