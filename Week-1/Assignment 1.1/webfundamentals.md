### What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web development?

#### A protocol stack is the set of rules that defines how the computers communicate with each other over network. The most commonly used protocal stack in web development is TCP/IP.

1.1] Application Layer: This is top layer which interact with the application or services. HTTP is application layer protocol are used to send data or communicate between web servers and web browsers.

1.2] Transport Layer: This layer is responsible for reliable data transfer. It uses TCP/ UDP to ensure that data is not lost.

1.3] Network Layer: This layer is responsible for routing data from one computer to another by using IP address to identify the computers on the network.

1.4] Data Link Layer: This layer is responsible for error detection and correction. It ensures that data is received without errors. Ethernet is a common data link layer protocol used for local network communication.

1.5] Physical Layer: This is the lowest layer which is responsible for the physical transmission of data over the network such as copper wires, fiber optics, or wireless signals, cables and routers.

### What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?

#### Scaling refers to ability of the system that can handle when traffic increase.

There are two main types of scaling: vertical scaling and horizontal scaling

4.1] Vertical scaling: It involves adding the capicity of existing hardware by adding more memory , cpu or storage to the single server.

4.2] Horizontal scaling: It involves by adding more servers to the system can be achieved by clustering servers
